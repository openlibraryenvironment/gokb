Version 8.0.0

  II - 2018-06-18 Added domain classes to model prices for components. Introduce ComponentPrice linked to Component
                  with price type and currency refdata, and start/end dates to track price changes over time.
                  getPrice(String type) and setPrice(String type, String value) added to KBComponent.
                  Price value processed as "%.2f CUR" where " CUR" is an optional currency which will be parsed out
                  and converted to refdata. Examples of price types are setPrice('list', '1.23 GBP'). Default type
                  is 'list' to set a list price. Other types seen include perpetual, top-up and subscriprion.

  II - 2018-06-18 Added ability for package/deposit endpoint to process arbitrary package level properties. initial config
                  added for pkg.price and pkg.price.TYPE - to pass values to the new domain model for prices. By setting
                  "pkg.price.perpetual=123.23 GBP" as a URL parameter, callers can now set prices against an uploaded package.
                  If prices are the same between uploads they will not be changed, if changes are detected, the old price
                  date range will be closed out and the new one created with the date range starting now and no end date.
                  See /gokb/testdata/archive_collections/brill/upload.sh for an example CURL command that sets package level prices

  II - 2018-06-18 Added ability for package/deposit endpoint to handle typed tipp level properties. Examples are
                  tipp.price.list, tipp.price.perpetual. Values are currency values, so float with optonal space + currency - examples
                  "1.23 EUR", "1.23", "11243.23 USD" etc.

  II - 2018-06-19 package/deposit now supports description parameter and KBComponent knows of a description property. Initially
                  to hold proquest package level descriptive text.

These two script variants select all components (A: journals & B: databases) that possess multiple
instances of identifiers of the same type.
Please note that '<id>' has to be replaced by the internal identifier pointing to the identifier that
has to be investigated.

A: Journals:

SELECT kbc1.kbc_id, tipp.kbc_id, pkg.kbc_id, cg.kbc_id, id1.kbc_id, id1.id_value
FROM combo AS co1, combo AS co2, combo AS co3, combo AS co4, kbcomponent AS kbc1, package AS pkg, title_instance_package_platform as tipp, curatory_group AS cg, journal_instance AS ji1, identifier AS id1
WHERE co1.combo_from_fk = kbc1.kbc_id
AND co1.combo_to_fk = tipp.kbc_id
AND co2.combo_from_fk = pkg.kbc_id
AND co2.combo_to_fk = tipp.kbc_id
AND co3.combo_from_fk = pkg.kbc_id
AND co3.combo_to_fk = cg.kbc_id
AND co4.combo_from_fk = kbc1.kbc_id
AND co4.combo_to_fk = id1.kbc_id
AND ji1.kbc_id = kbc1.kbc_id
AND id1.id_namespace_fk = 41602
AND kbc1.kbc_id = ANY (
    SELECT kbc.kbc_id
    FROM combo AS co, kbcomponent AS kbc, journal_instance AS ji, identifier AS id
    WHERE co.combo_from_fk = kbc.kbc_id
    AND co.combo_to_fk = id.kbc_id
    AND ji.kbc_id = kbc.kbc_id
    AND id.id_namespace_fk = <id>
    GROUP BY kbc.kbc_id
    HAVING COUNT(kbc.kbc_id) > 1
);

B: Databases:

                <AnnotationText>It seems likely that category (d) in clause 1.1.2 may be intended to cover walk-in users, but this would be inconsistent with the statement that all categories have 'general access' to the licensee's network.  Provisionally, the Dictionary term 'Library Users Unaffiliated' could be regarded as covering categories (c) and (d).</AnnotationText>

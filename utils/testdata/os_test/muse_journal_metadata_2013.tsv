philoSOPHIA	State University of New York Press	2	http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/philosophia	2155-0905	2155-0891	613211663	Vol. 1, no. 1, spring 2011		Y	No	Vol. 1 (2011) through current issue	Continental Philosophy	Women's Studies		X							philoSOPHIA is the first philosophical journal that marries the rich traditions and conceptual resources of continental philosophy and feminist theory. While the field of feminist philosophy generally has committed itself to resuscitating and transforming the traditional imagery and representation of women (and maternity and femininity), the field of “continental feminism” more specifically has provided the resources for reconceptualizing the historical legacy of European philosophy and the figures of the feminine and sexual difference that have been cultivated therein. The journal aims to explore and excavate this feminine figure throughout the history of philosophy, and to include articles that consider the relation of the feminine to nature, the body, language, and subjectivity, perhaps most especially work that considers the ways in which the figure of the feminine maintains but also quite possibly undermines the schisms between and among these central elements of human reality. The critical endeavors of this journal contribute to a feminist renewal and a renewal of philosophical culture, a potential rebirth of feminist theory in a philosophical ethos that will enhance rather than exclude it. philoSOPHIA will be of interest to scholars from diverse disciplines who are interested in continental philosophy and/or feminist theory generally, all those who are pursuing questions concerning sexual difference, and others working in the fields of women’s studies, literature, political theory, race theory, queer theory, psychoanalysis, aesthetics, philosophy of nature, and phenomenology.

What tools are needed to characterize, in all its richness and complexity, the experience of inhabiting a narrative world in a given medium or across different media?

As a consequence, new, incultured forms of Christianity are emerging, and these are being analysed, described, and argued for and against by Christians and other students of religion in each culture. The result is new developments in theology, Scripture studies, church history, morality and religious studies; from all of which there is much to be learned, especially in the West. And yet activists in one culture often do not know what is being done in another culture. Indeed, exponents of one of the disciplinary areas above often do not know what is developing in this way in a cognate area. Hence the need for a truly intercultural, interdisciplinary journal. It is this need that Studies in World Christianity is designed to meet, and does so with increasing and acknowledged success.

In 1997, reflecting the growing trend among historians and historically oriented social scientists to emphasize the historical continuities in China's twentieth-century experience (rather than adhering to the somewhat artificial categories of "Republican" and "People's Republic" history), editor Steve Averill persuaded the board to rename the journal Twentieth-Century China.
